Primary Objectives:

To study the role and interrelationships of established and novel clinical, environmental, biological, and genetic prenatal and early-life factors in the development of allergic diseases through age 3 years, with an emphasis on atopic dermatitis and food allergy
To apply systems biology to identify mechanisms and biomarkers underlying the development of food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and their endotypes

allergy to metals restenosis in-stent restenosis coronary artery disease,Allergy / Immunology,0,Metal Allergy Contact Allergy Restenoses Coronary In-stent Restenosis Coronary Artery Disease,"In-stent restenosis remains one of the most challenging problems in patients after coronary artery angioplasty. Angiographically, it is discovered in 10% of the patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. There are multiple factors causing restenosis, which can be divided into two major groups: first vessel-dependent (based on the vessel's tortuosity, dimensions and lesion's calcification, all leading to suboptimal stent expansion), and second dependent on the inflammatory processes caused by the intervention. Study objectives is the analysis of the possible correlation between allergy to metals utilised during the stent manufacturing (nickel, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten) and in-stent restenosis occurence. The angiographic results of stent implantation, and in-stent restenosis will be assessed independently by two skilled interventional cardiologists, and in case of their discrepant opinions, the decision will be made on the basis of the third cardiologist. The tests will be applicated during the hospitalisation, then read after 48 hours and 72 hours, and subsequently interpreted by the skilled dermatologist, during the hospital stay or afterwards."

Subjects and staff will remain blinded to the treatment received in the TL7116958 study (GSK2245035 or placebo). The study will consist of a screening visit to assess eligibility criteria, a study period consisting of a single visit when the nasal allergen challenge will be performed, and follow up by phone or a clinic visit at the discretion of the investigator 4-7 days following the allergen challenge. Eligible subjects will participate in this study for approximately70 days total from screening to follow up."

gluten sensitivity GS gluten intolerance allergic autoimmune gluten-related disorders,Allergy / Immunology,0,gluten sensitivity,"Recently a new clinical entity, gluten sensitivity (GS), a form of gluten intolerance in which neither allergic nor autoimmune mechanisms can be identified, has been added to the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms including abdominal pain (68%); eczema or rash (40%); headache (35%); diarrhoea (33%) and fatigue (33%). The small intestine of GS patient is usually normal. The prevalence of GS is not yet established although it is estimated that up to 6% of the general population might be affected. GS has been described only in adults and no data are available for the paediatric population.The main problem with this new condition is that, at present, there are no speci���������������������������c biomarkers to con���������������������������rm GS diagnosis. In the absence of a serological or histological marker, the diagnosis remains clinical. In order to avoid placebo effect of the dietary treatment, presently GS diagnosis needs to performed with double-blind randomized placebo-controlled challenge provided that both wheat allergy and CD have previously been excluded."
